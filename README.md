With the popularization of automobile and the progress of computer vision detection technology, intelligent number plate detection technology has gradually become an 
important part of intelligent traffic management. Number plate detection is used to segment vehicle image and obtain number plate area for follow-up recognition system
to screen. It is widely used in intelligent traffic management, vehicle video monitoring and other fields. 

So therefore we have develop Vehicle’s Number plate recognition and detection system. It is a real time embedded system which can be automatically detect number plate 
of vehicle’s through images or videos. It can capture a real time video. A number plate is the unique identification of vehicle. It is an image processing technology
used to identify vehicles by their own number plates using Opencv and EasyOCR .It plays an important role in maintaining law enforcement and maintaining traffic rules.
It has wide applications areas such as toll plaza, parking area, highly security areas, boarder’s areas etc. 

Number plate recognition is designed to identify the number plate and then recognize the vehicle number plate from a moving vehicle automatically. Automatic number plate
recognition has three major parts: vehicle number plate extraction, character segmentation and Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The innovativeness of a vehicle number
plate detection project using EasyOCR and OpenCV lies in its ability to leverage existing technologies in a creative and efficient manner to solve a practical problem.
The contribution of this project extends beyond its immediate application, influencing various aspects of transportation, security, and urban development. It serves as a
foundational technology that supports numerous societal benefits and advancements. It offers a powerful solution for automatically identifying and recognizing number plates
from images and videos. This system combines the strengths of computer vision techniques with deep learning-based optical character recognition to accurately detect and 
extract alphanumeric characters from number plates.
